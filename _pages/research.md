Calibrating the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method with numerical simulations
======

I applied the DCF methods on simulated 3D MHD and radiative transfer simulations of massive star formation (made with RAMSES and POLARIS) to better understand the applicability of the DCF method on small-scale and high-density star-forming regions with significant gravity.

Magnetic fields in 3 massive clumps in IRDC G28.34 ([ADS link]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895..142L/abstract))
======
With ALMA observations of the 1.3 mm polarized emission of the dust continuum in three massive molecular clumps (~1 pc) MM1, MM4, and MM9 in IRDC G28.34+0.06, I investigated the role of B fields in the early stage of massive star formation. Using the angular dispersion function method (a modified DCF method), the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength in two massive dense cores, MM1-Core1 and MM4-Core4, are estimated to be ~1.6 mG and ~0.32 mG, respectively. The total virial parameters in MM1-Core1 and MM4-Core4 are calculated to be $\sim$0.76 and $\sim$0.37, respectively, suggesting that massive star formation does not start in equilibrium. Half of the outflows in MM4 and MM9 are found to be aligned within 10$^{circ}$ of the condensation-scale (<0.05 pc) magnetic field, indicating that the magnetic field could play an important role from condensation to disk scale in the early stage of massive star formation.

Magnetic fields in the low-mass starless core Ophiuchus C ([ADS link]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877...43L/abstract))
======
As part of the JCMT B-fields in STar-forming Region Observations ([BISTRO](https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/large-programs/gb_bfields/)) project, 
I investigated the role of B field in the low-mass starless dense core Oph-C. The power-law index of the polarization percentage-total intensity (P-I) relation is found to be close to -1. I estimated the plane-of-sky field strength (Bpos) using modified Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) methods based on [structure function (Hildebrand et al. 2009)]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...696..567H/abstract), [autocorrelation function (ACF, Houde et al. 2009)]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...706.1504H/abstract), and [unsharp masking (Pattle et al. 2017)]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...846..122P/abstract)  analyses. The calculations yield Bpos of 0.1~0.2 mG and local magnetic stability critical parameter of 1~3, suggesting that the Oph-C core is near magnetically critical or slightly magnetically supercritical (i.e., unstable to collapse).

The Isothermal Outflow in High-mass Star-forming Region G240.31+0.07 ([ADS link]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860..106L/abstract ))
======
Molecular outflows are a common phenomenon associated with young stellar objects (YSOs) of all masses. Using CSO, APEX, and SMA observations, I performed a multi-transition CO (J=2-1, 3-2, 6-5, and 7-6 ) analysis toward understanding the physical conditions of the outflowing gas associated with G240.31+0.07. With large velocity gradient (LVG) calculations (using the radiative transfer code [RADEX](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/radex.html)), I found that the outflow is approximately isothermal with a gas temperature of ∼50 K and that the CO column density clearly decreases with the outflow velocity, which indicates the outflow is being driven by a wide-angle wind.
