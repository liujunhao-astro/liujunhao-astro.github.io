## <ins>1.Observational studies of B fields in molecular clouds</ins>

### Multi-scale magnetic properties in evolved high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334 ([Liu et al. 2023a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...945..160L/abstract))

Using dust polarization data from ALMA, JCMT, and Planck, I comprehensively investigated the multi-scale (e.g., $\sim$10 pc clouds, $\sim$1 pc clumps, $\sim$0.1 pc cores, $\sim$0.01 pc condensations...) B field property in the nearby evolved massive star formation region NGC 6334. The multi-scale B field study across 4 orders of magnitude is important for the  development of massive star formation theories.

### Initial condition of low-mass and high-mass star formation ([Liu et al. 2019]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877...43L/abstract),[2020]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895..142L/abstract), and 2024)

In Liu et al. 2019, I investigated the B field properties in the low-mass starless core Ophiuchus C using dust polarization observations from JCMT, which provided one of the earliest observational evidences for the B properties in early low-mass star formation. 

In Liu et al. 2020. and 2024, I studied the the multi-scale B of the massive infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization data from Planck, JCMT, and ALMA. These two studies clearly reveals the role of B fields at different scales in an individual IRDC, which presents a cloud-to-condensation-scale B field study in an early-stage massive star formation region and fills in the gap of such studies.

### Calibrating the DCF method with numerical simulations ([Liu et al. 2021]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919...79L/abstract))

We conducted a numerical study using a series of 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and radiative transfer simulations (made with [RAMSES](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html) and [POLARIS](https://portia.astrophysik.uni-kiel.de/polaris/)) of clustered star formation regions with different magnetic and turbulent levels, aiming at investigating the uncertainty of the DCF method at sub-parsec scales (i.e., dense clumps/cores) that are associated with significant self-gravity.

### A Compilation of All the DCF Estimations ([Liu et al. 2022a]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...30L/abstract))

I collected all the DCF estimations of B strength from polarized dust emission observations in the literature (230 estimations from 75 papers) and corrected them with numerical results (Liu et al. 2021). The statistical study systematically reveals the general property of B fields in star formation regions, which is instructive for the development of future star formation theories.

### A review of statistical methods used to study magnetic field properties ([Liu et al. 2022b]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.3556L/abstract))

We have recently reviewed the advances and limitations of several analysis methods of magnetic fields and summarized their applications to observations. For instance, the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method ([Davis & Greenstein, 1951]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951PhRv...81..890D/abstract), [Chandrasekhar & Fermi, 1953]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1953ApJ...118..113C/abstract) ), the polarization-intensity gradient (KTH) method ([Koch et al., 2012]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...747...79K/abstract)), and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) analysis ([Soler et al., 2013]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...774..128S/abstract)).
