I'm a PhD candidate at [School of Astronomy & Space Science, Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Keping Qiu](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~kqiu/cv.html). I'm currently enrolled in a long-term pre-doctoral program at Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian supervised by Dr. [Qizhou Zhang](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~qzhang/).

My research interests focus on the physical phenomena associated with the star formation process in our Galaxy. I mainly use mm/sub-mm observations from CSO, APEX, JCMT, SMA, and ALMA to investigate the role of molecular outflows and magnetic fields (B fields) from clump scales (~1 pc) down to condensation scales (~0.01 pc). Besides, I'm also learning to use results of MHD simulations to explore the applicability of different modified Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi methods in deriving the magnetic field strength in high-density star-forming regions.
