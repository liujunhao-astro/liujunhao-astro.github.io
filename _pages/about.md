I have been an EAO fellow (post-doctoral) at the [East Asian Observatory (EAO)](https://www.eaobservatory.org/) since June 2021. I obtained my PhD in March 2021 from [Nanjing University (南京大学)](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Keping Qiu (邱科平)](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/szgk/js/20190816/i13834.html). I was enrolled in a long-term pre-doctoral program at [Center for Astrophysics (CfA) \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) supervised by Dr. [Qizhou Zhang (张其洲)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~qzhang/) from August 2018 through May 2021. I was born in 1993 and grew up in a small town in Dianjiang, Chongqing (Sichuan), China.

My research interests focus on studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation, especially in the early stage, with polarized dust emission observations using mm/submm single-dish telescopes and telescope arrays (e.g., [JCMT](http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/), [SMA](http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/), [ALMA](https://almascience.nrao.edu/)). The main goals of my research are: 1) numerically calibrating the statistical methods used to assess the role of magnetic fields; 2) applying these methods on dust polarization maps of star-forming regions and quantitatively assessing the relative importance of the magnetic field compared to gravity and turbulence at different scales; 3) addressing the dynamical role of the magnetic field in the fragmentation and collapse of dense clumps and cores.
