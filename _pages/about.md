I have been a postdoctoral fellow at the East Asian Observatory (EAO) since July 2021. I obtained my PhD in March 2021 from [School of Astronomy & Space Science, Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Keping Qiu](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/szgk/js/20190816/i13834.html). I was enrolled in a long-term pre-doctoral program at [Center for Astrophysics (CfA) \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) supervised by Dr. [Qizhou Zhang](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~qzhang/) from August 2018 through May 2021.

My research interests focus on studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation, especially in the early stage, with polarized dust emission observations using mm/submm single-dish telescopes and telescope arrays (e.g., JCMT, SMA, ALMA). The main goals of my research are to calibrate the statistical methods used to estimate the magnetic field strength with numerical simulations, apply these methods on dust polarization maps to derive the field strength, quantitatively assess the relative importance of the magnetic field compared to gravity and turbulence, and addressing the dynamical role of magnetic fields in the fragmentation and collapse of dense clumps and cores.
